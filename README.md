# A Simple Stock Ticker Visualization App

Hello! This little stock ticker visualization web app was created by [Matt Chan](http://github.com/thewchan/) as part of his adventure over the [The Data Incubator Data Science Fellowship](https://www.thedataincubator.com). This app was the on-boarding assignment prior to the beginning of the actual fellowship program. Check out the source code of the app here at Github, and see it live over at [Heroku](https://mychan-stock.herokuapp.com/)! Some skeleton file and code were provided by TDI themselves. The interactive visualization is powered by [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), an open source interactive visualization Python library. The stock price time series data is provided by [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/), who provides free APIs for financial trends. The website itself is powered by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), a micro web framework written in Python which is in turn powered by [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) and [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/), a template engine and a web server gateway interface toolkit, respectively. The CSS of the web app is powered by [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/), a set of CSS modules designed by [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/), with minor modification. The favicon was provided by [Free Favicon](https://freefavicon.com/). Enjoy!
