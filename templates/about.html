          <p>
              Hello! This little stock ticker visualization web app was created by <a class="post-author" href="http://github.com/thewchan/">Matt Chan</a> as part of his adventure over the <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/">The Data Incubator Data Science Fellowship</a>. This app was the on-boarding assignment prior to the beginning of the actual fellowship program. Check out the source code of the app <a href="https://github.com/thewchan/stock-ticker-app">here</a>! This app is hosted by <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku.</a> Some skeleton file and code were provided by TDI themselves. The interactive visualization is powered by <a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh</a>, an open source interactive visualization Python library. The stock price time series data is provided by <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a>, who provides free APIs for financial trends. The website itself is powered by <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>, a micro web framework written in Python which is in turn powered by <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> and <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/">Werkzeug</a>, a template engine and a web server gateway interface toolkit, respectively. The CSS of the web app is powered by <a href="https://purecss.io/">Pure.css</a>, a set of CSS modules designed by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>, with minor modification. The favicon was provided by <a href="https://freefavicon.com/">Free Favicon</a>. Enjoy!
